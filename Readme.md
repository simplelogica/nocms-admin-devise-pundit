# nocms-admin-devise-pundit

This Rails engine adds admins users to NoCms Admin by using Devise to handle all the authentication and Pundit for the permissions.

This gem is not called nocms-admin-users as other alternatives can be used for this (e.g cancancan) and we rather not to use the a generic name.
